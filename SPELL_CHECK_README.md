# Spell Checking Feature

## Overview

The Calliope vocabulary app now includes intelligent spell checking functionality to help users who cannot spell perfectly. When a word is not found in the dictionary, the app automatically provides spelling suggestions that users can click to try again.

## How It Works

### User Experience
1. User types a word in the "Add Word" tab
2. **NEW**: Spell checking happens BEFORE calling OpenAI API
3. If the word is misspelled:
   - The app displays a "Did you mean?" section
   - Shows up to 5 spelling suggestions with confidence scores
   - User can click on any suggestion to retry with the corrected spelling
   - User can also click "Cancel" to dismiss suggestions

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend
- **New API Endpoint**: `/api/spell-check`
- **Library**: Uses `pyspellchecker` Python library
- **Confidence Scoring**: Calculates confidence based on edit distance
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when spell checking fails
- **ðŸ†• Pre-validation**: Spell checking now happens BEFORE OpenAI API calls

#### Frontend
- **Automatic Triggering**: Spell checking activates when word addition fails
- **Interactive UI**: Clean, modern interface for selecting suggestions
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with existing add word functionality

## ðŸ”§ **Fixed Issue: OpenAI Smart Interpretation**

### Problem
Previously, OpenAI's API was smart enough to interpret misspelled words (like "acommodate") and return correct definitions, but this would store the misspelled word in the database.

### Solution
Now spell checking happens **before** calling OpenAI:
1. User enters word â†’ Spell check first
2. If misspelled â†’ Show suggestions
3. If correctly spelled â†’ Proceed to OpenAI
4. Only correctly spelled words get stored in database

### Database Cleanup
If you have misspelled words already in your database, use the cleanup script:

```bash
# Check for misspelled words
python cleanup_misspelled.py

# Auto-correct them
python cleanup_misspelled.py --auto-correct
```

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/spell-check`
Check spelling of a word and get suggestions.

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "word": "definately"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "original_word": "definately",
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "word": "Definitely",
      "confidence": 0.85
    },
    {
      "word": "Definite",
      "confidence": 0.72
    }
  ],
  "found_exact_match": false
}
```

## Installation

1. Install the new dependency:
```bash
pip install pyspellchecker==0.8.1
```

2. Restart the backend server

## Testing

Now when you test with misspelled words like:
- "acommodate" â†’ Should suggest "accommodate"
- "definately" â†’ Should suggest "definitely"
- "seperate" â†’ Should suggest "separate"

The app will show spell suggestions instead of storing incorrect spellings!

## Features

- **Smart Suggestions**: Provides relevant spelling corrections
- **Confidence Scores**: Shows how likely each suggestion is correct
- **User-Friendly**: Clean, intuitive interface
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when spell checking fails
- **Performance**: Fast response times for better user experience
- **ðŸ†• Pre-validation**: Prevents misspelled words from reaching OpenAI
- **ðŸ†• Database Protection**: Only correctly spelled words get stored

## Styling

The spell suggestions interface uses the same design language as the rest of the app:
- Gradient backgrounds matching the app theme
- Responsive grid layout
- Hover effects and animations
- Mobile-friendly design

## Database Cleanup Script

The `cleanup_misspelled.py` script helps manage existing misspelled entries:

- **Check Mode**: `python cleanup_misspelled.py`
  - Reports all potentially misspelled words
  - Shows suggested corrections
  - Provides SQL commands for manual cleanup

- **Auto-Correct Mode**: `python cleanup_misspelled.py --auto-correct`
  - Automatically corrects misspelled words
  - Deletes duplicates if correct spelling already exists
  - Safe database operations with rollback on errors

## Future Enhancements

- Custom dictionary based on user's vocabulary
- Context-aware suggestions
- Multi-language support
- Learning from user corrections
- Whitelist for technical terms and proper nouns
